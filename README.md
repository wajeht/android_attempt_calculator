# Powerlifting Attempt Selection Calculator
This app was developed by using coach Matt Gary guidance on which percentages where best to attempt at a powerlifting meet. There is no attempt selection calculator on both android and iOS AppStore. So I decided to wrote this as a side project. This will be available on both paltform for free to download in a few week.
